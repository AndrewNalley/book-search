# Book Search Engine 

## Description

This is a Google Books API search engine with a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. It uses a MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server. The previous RESTful API was replaced with a GraphQL API. 

Software development is an evironment full of constantly changing technologies. This project was an exercise in updating an already working app with new features.
